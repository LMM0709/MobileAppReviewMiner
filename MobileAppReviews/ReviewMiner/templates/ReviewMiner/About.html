        <h1>Mobile Application Review Mining</h1>
        </div>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>With increasing competition in mobile marketplace, developers are working on getting their application better.
            Every application in mobile application store gets hundreds of reviews. Some of them are really good praising
            the application. But some of them are low rated reviews which signifies any improvements needed in this
            application or any suggestions from the user that they would like to have improved. Sometimes developer may
            encounter with very short and irrelevant reviews. As the number of reviews increases, it becomes difficult for
            developer to sort out the most helpful reviews from this large corpus. Their main task is to filter out the most
            helpful and informative reviews and categorize them according to different areas of improvements like performance,
            stability, compatibility with multiple devices, user interface etc. Objective of this application is to assist
            the mobile app developers in categorizing the reviews into different areas of improvements. This will expedite
            the process of getting informative feedback from application users and to work on quality improvement of their
            application.</p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This application allows developer to put <b>filter on the rating of reviews</b>. Suppose developer just
                    want to consider reviews which got the rating below 3. Then our application will give the option to
                    select such filter and then it will parse only those reviews which are below rating 3.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This application also allows user to see the <b>reviews by criteria</b>. Suppose, the developer just
                    want to see reviews which are related to compatibility of the application, then he can select the
                    compatibility tabs on the side to choose reviews related to compatibility. Developer can click on
                    ‘All Reviews’ to select the reviews which falls in all the criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This application also displays the <b>statistics in graphical form</b> based on how these reviews
                    are categorized. This will help developers to focus on particular area of improvement for their
                    application.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Workflow</h3>
        <p>
            Every android application developer gets their review data in csv (comma separated value) format from google.
            If you are an android mobile developer then you can get your review data by following the steps given at
            following link.
            <br/>
            <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/138230?hl=en"
               class="btn btn-link" role="button">Get the reviews data from play store for your android app</a>
            <br/>
            The project is a web application which allows the developer to upload their csv file on the site.
            It also allows to filter reviews based on rating level.
            <br/><br/>
            <font align = "center">
            <img id="HomeImg" class="screenshots" height="60%" width="60%" border="5"
                 src="{% static 'Images/HomePage.jpg' %}" alt="Home Page" />
            <br/><br/>
            </font>

            Then we have defined various criteria for mobile applications such as Performance, User Interface,
            Compatibility, Request by user and  General improvements. When user clicks on `upload` button on the home page,
            it will show the reviews which are most helpful from application improvement perspective.
            <br/><br/>
            <font align = "center">
            <img id="AllReviewsImg" class="screenshots" height="60%" width="60%" border="5"
                 src="{% static 'Images/AllReviews.JPG' %}" alt="All Reviews" />
            <br/><br/>
            </font>
            This application will parse each review to perform natural language processing on each of the review text
            and it tries to find out the whether the review is related to performance, compatibility or any other criteria.

            <div class = "well">
            <p>For example, If a review says <b><i>‘very slow,	It takes lot of time to update call directory and hangs many times’</i></b>
                This type of review is helpful for mobile developer. It will allow developer to understand what the problem is
                and decide upon the appropriate action to take to improve. Like in this review, developer came to know that
                there are some issues with call directory update and something makes this operation slow. The application
                will categorize this review in the category of Performance and highlight words like 'slow' and  'hangs'.</p>
            </div>
            <br/><br/>
            <font align = "center">
            <img id="GraphViewImg" class="screenshots" height="60%" width="60%" border="5"
                 src="{% static 'Images/GraphView.JPG' %}" alt="Graph View" />
            <br/><br/>
            </font>
            <br/>
            For detailed understanding of the application working please refer following video:

        <h3>Technologies and Architecture</h3>
        <p>No doubt that we got to learn lot of new technologies and implement them. </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Our application is developed completely in
                    <a href="https://www.python.org/" role="button"><i>Python</i></a>.
                    Since Python is very flexible, easy to use and very powerful language, we decided to try our hands on this language through this project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It uses <a href= "http://www.nltk.org/" role="button"><i>Python Natural Language Toolkit</i></a> (NLTK)to perform the natural language processing of the review text.
                    Python NLTK has rich set functionality and documentation available, which allows the text parsing in easy
                    and effective manner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Web application is developed in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" role="button"><i>Django framework</i></a>
                    for Python which is very again useful and easy to manage framework.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are using <b><i>strategy architecture pattern</i></b> behind this code logic.
                    It basically identifies various improvement areas and applies respective strategy
                    to parse the review text for that particular improvement area.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" role="button"><i>Bootstrap</i></a> framework to display the web page.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Limitations and Future scope</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Currently this application works only for the CSVs given in the prescribed format as mentioned above.
                    In future, we can try to accommodate the reviews in the CSV which might be in different formats.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Support for the mobile marketplace can be increased from Google play store to
                    Apple App store or windows application store etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This application just provides support for processing of reviews which are written in English language.
                    Python NLTK also provides support for other languages as well and we can incorporate them in subsequent releases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The list of criteria based on which reviews are parsed is currently fixed.  In future scope, we can allow user to
                    participate in defining the criteria with which he wants to detect reviews related to particular area of improvement.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Currently filtered reviews are just shown to user. In future we can have status for each filtered review.
                    For example when user is working on particular review, he should be able to mark it as ‘In Progress’.
                    And further when user is done with working, user should be able to mark that review as ‘fixed’.
                    So that it won’t show up in the list again.
                </li>

                <li>
                    We can provide the option of extracting the output which we are getting on the web application
                    and should allow the user to save the results so as to refer the output again when offline.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
